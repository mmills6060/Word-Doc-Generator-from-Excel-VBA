# Word-Doc-Generator-from-Excel-VBA
#Description
This is a project that I built to automate an autonomous task. My primary goal was to take data from an excel spreadsheet and build something that would be able to automatically write letters for me to clients. For example, this way, I would not need to copy and paste the name, address, date, etc. of our 1000s of clients, and I would be able to push a button to automatically generate 1000s of letters with the click of a button.
