# Word-Doc-Generator-from-Excel-VBA
# Description
This is a project that I built to automate an autonomous task. My primary goal was to build something that would be able to take data from excel and automatically write letters for me to clients, using the data that is provided in excel. For example, this way, I would not need to copy and paste the name, address, date, etc. of our hundreds of thousands of clients, and I would be able to push a button to automatically generate 1000s of letters with the click of a button. Of course, I recognize that there are probably better and more efficient languages that can be used for this particular project, however I was completely walled off in terms of the languages and tools that I could use in my everyday job. If the company that you work for is strict about the applications that you put on a virtual desktop, Excel VBA might be your only option to automate mindless tasks.
# How it works
This tool uses a template word document. It then uses string search and string replace to take the already exisitng words and replace them with specific cell values that are contianed within the excel file. It then works down the excel column until there arent any values left at the bottom of the row. The script will create word documents for each row. This can be incredibly powerful especially if you have a large database of clients.
